<h2>Google Analytics Results</h2>
<p>The distribution of referrers for our traffic is as follows: SOM (8.4%), Divinity (35.7%), Medicine (2.8%), Law (29.2%), and Search (24.0%).</p>
<p>After running our A/B test of the Donate/Support button on event pages, we found that XXX is more effective at garnering donations to support events. Specifically, the version of the event page with “Donate” saw xx% click through, while the version of the event page with “Support” saw xx% click through.s</p>

<h2>Final Team Retrospective</h2>
<h3>Reflection on what we did well as a team</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Communication via WhatsApp was our primary mode of both keeping each other up to date on developments as well as raising issues. This generally worked well and was an easier way to track project developments than Github.</li>
    <li>Using Zenhub to track user stories also proved effective. The team was able to implement user stories following acceptance criteria and the definition of done (DOD).</li>
</ol>
<h3>What we learned towards the end that could have helped us</h3>
<ol>
    <li>We encountered an issue at the end - bots no longer coming through to the site thus preventing realizing results on our A/B test of “donate” vs. “support” language. We brought everyone together into one thread eventually and, with Kyle’s help, identified the issue. We might have gotten here sooner had we had a more vertically aligned process in which one person owned one task; however, this also would require everyone knowing how to do all components (e.g., code, analytics, manage, etc.). To be more efficient in our current process, we might have created a more standardized channel through which to raise issues encountered. </li>
</ol>
