<p>We used google optimize to conduct an A/B test of whether users are more likely to support an event when they see a &apos;donate&apos; or &apos;support&apos; call to action. Due to some challenges of funneling traffic to our site, we do not yet have conclusive evidence to distinguish the winner. With the few bots who have viewed the event pages being tested and took action, it looks like the conversion rate on &apos;Donate&apos; is higher, ~ 50% Vs. <20% for &apos;support&apos;. That being said, the sample size is small and such results could be due to random chance.</p>

<h2>Final Team Retrospective</h2>
<h3>Reflection on what we did well as a team</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Communication via WhatsApp was our primary mode of both keeping each other up to date on developments as well as raising issues. This generally worked well and complemented our usage of ZenHub as a central product backlog for development.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, using Zenhub to track user stories also proved effective. The team was able to implement user stories following acceptance criteria and the definition of done (DOD).</li>
</ol>
<h3>What we learned towards the end that could have helped us</h3>
<ol>
    <li>We encountered an issue at the end - bots no longer coming through to the site due to an incorrect application url thus impacted traffic and the results on our A/B test of &quot;donate&quot; vs. &quot;support&quot; language. We brought everyone together into one thread eventually and, with Kyle&apos;s help, identified the issue. We might have gotten here sooner had we had a more vertically aligned process in which one person owned one task; however, this also would required everyone knowing how to do all components (e.g., code, analytics, product management, etc.). To be more efficient in our current process, we might have created a more standardized channel through which to raise issues encountered. </li>
</ol>
